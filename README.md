# Puzzle: Stick Cutting

This repository contains some simple code to illustrate how Monte
Carlo methods can be used to build up mathematics intuition.  Note
that a state-space based analysis is relatively easy, and those who
are familar with that kind of approach wouldn't need to use this
applied mathematics style approach.  This is intended for beginners.

## Stick Cutting

The puzzle is as follows:

Given a mathematical stick (infinitely thin, so modeled as a line
segment), make two uniformly random cuts.  This yields three sticks,
the sum of the lengths of which should equal to the original, which,
without loss of generality, is of length 1.

What is the probability that the three sticks can be laid down
end-to-end to form a triangle?

(Alternatively, pick two points at which to install a hinge, and ...)
